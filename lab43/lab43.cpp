   About this program: 
   This program mimics an online shopping cart.  You are the proprieter of an online shop and have to keep track 
   of inventory, price and the userâ€™s shopping cart. Create a class to hold the object name, price, and current 
   inventory.  The program outputs all of the object names for your user to choose what they want.  As the user 
   purchases an item, you should remove that item from inventory (subtract 1) and add the price to a total.  When the 
   user is done adding items to their cart, you should output a statement of what they have ordered and the total cost of 
   their purchases.  The program does not let inventory go below 0.
